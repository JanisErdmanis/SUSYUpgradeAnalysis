	* going into RootCore-00-04-14

2014-10-29 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* put in a fix that prevents a file failing from strip processing
	  the remaining files.  this is needed for fastjet, which puts a
	  text file into its binary path.
	* going into RootCore-00-04-13

2014-10-29 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* removed the restriction to 1 CPU when running on the grid
	* taking the number of CPUs from ATHENA_PROC_NUMBER if
	  ROOTCORE_NCPUS is not set.  this is set by the pilot on the grid.
	* going into RootCore-00-04-12

2014-10-27 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed get_arch, so that it will set ROOTCORECONFIG to
	  x86_64-slc6-gcc47-opt, which is set by AtlasLocalSetup.  or if
	  that is not set it will set ROOTCORECONFIG to generic, so that it
	  will be clear that this is using a custom setup
	* going into RootCore-00-04-11

2014-10-09 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Adding the --shell option to scripts/setup.sh
	* Tagging RootCore-00-04-10

2014-10-08 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Updating auto-complete feature in env_setup to only work in bash.
	  Support for other shells can be added if requested and as solutions
	  are proposed. This was done by adding a --shell option to env_setup,
	  which is set appropriately in local_setup.sh

2014-10-01 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* added an auto-initialization of the xAOD classes during
	  load_packages.C
	* going into RootCore-00-04-09

2014-09-29 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Tagging RootCore-00-04-08

2014-09-28 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Moved command name dictionaries from the rc script into functions in
	  the commands module. This allowed to simplify the code in the rc
	  script, and will allow me to add bash auto-completion in env_setup.
	* Added bash auto-completion for rc commands in env_setup. The
	  'complete' command is only applied in base_setup, and uses all of
	  the standard commands and script commands (not the internal
	  commands).

2014-09-11 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed get_cxxflags and get_ldflags which were broken by the
	  restructuring of the RootCore python packages
	* going into RootCore-00-04-07

	  compilation to fail
	* going into RootCore-00-04-03

2014-08-28 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* added ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH to the setup to make releases compatible
	  with root 6
	* going into RootCore-00-04-02

2014-08-23 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>

	  import statement
	* going into RootCore-00-04-01

2014-08-22 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed a couple of problems (mostly missing imports) and then
	  merged the branch back into the trunk
	* going into RootCore-00-04-00

2014-08-20 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Migrated internal/env_setup script to use the new modules

2014-08-07 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Created development branch RootCore-00-03-59-branch

		* compile.py holds the Makefile-related classes
		* externals.py holds the external lib management functionality
		* package.py holds the PackageList and PackageInfo classes
		* svninfo.py holds the SvnInfo classes
		* utils.py holds the shell utilities and other generic utility
		  functions
		* workarea.py holds the RelPath and WorkArea classes
	* Added rc-dev to test module usage, but I will soon just replace rc
	  for more complete testing.
	* Simultaneously updating and cleaning parts of the code
		* Split up some long lines
		* Removed usage of deprecated string module functions in favor
		  of native str methods.

2014-07-31 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* put in a minor fix in the handling of .dylib files, i.e. how they
	  get linked as .so files so that root can find them...
	* going into RootCore-00-03-59

2014-07-31 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>

	* going into RootCore-00-03-57

2014-07-21 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>

	  AtlasLocalSetup to determine ROOTCORECONFIG (if AtlasLocalSetup
	  is available
	* going into RootCore-00-03-56

2014-07-21 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed a bug that let to RootCore setting up ROOTCOREARCH
	  incorrectly on the grid.
	* reduced the number of CPUs used on the grid and batch systems to
	  1
	* going into RootCore-00-03-55

2014-07-13 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed a bug/typo introduced in the last commit, which broke the
	  'rc compile' command when used with a virgin installation
	* going into RootCore-00-03-55

2014-07-10 Steve Farrell <steven.farrell@cern.ch>
	* Added a few notes in the form of comments ("# NOTE: ...") to be
	  followed up on later.
	* Reworked some long shell_exec lines into smaller statements. There
	  are still more to do.
	* Removed imp.load_source usage in 'rc', which shouldn't be necessary
	  since RootCore can trivially load modules that sit in the same
	  directory as the script.
	* Note, I rebased some git commits on top of Nils's recent change, so
	  in the SVN history there may be some irrelevant comments in places
	  that I've now removed.
	* Tagging RootCore-00-03-54

2014-07-10 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* added a lot of comments to RootCore.py to make it easier for
	  others to understand how it is working
	* going into RootCore-00-03-53

2014-07-07 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed the detection mechanisms in check_dep

2014-07-04 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed a problem where find_packages broke after calling compile
	  when using the analysis release
	* going into RootCore-00-03-50

2014-07-01 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed a bug from the last time in which auto-dependenciees where
	  not correctly propageted, causing the 2.0.X nightlies to fail.
	* going into RootCore-00-03-49

2014-06-24 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed a bug in the last version, that prevented compilation when
	  taking RootCore from a release.
	* going into RootCore-00-03-48

2014-06-23 Nils Krumnack <Nils.Erik.Krumnack@cern.ch>
	* fixed it, so that auto-dependencies get picked up by all packages
	* fixed it, so that if packages modify their compiler flags it gets
	  picked up correctly.
	* going into RootCore-00-03-47

2014-06-01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Making RootCore.WorkArea.root_version() fall back on the
	  result of `root-config --version` in case the manual extraction
	  doesn't work. To be honest, the code should just do this
	  all the time instead of doing all the unnecessary string
	  manipulation all the time. :-/
	* Added the hacked version of the PCM file installation for the
	  ROOT 6 compilation. This still only works in local compilation
	  mode as the PCM files are put into a location that's cleaned up
	  by "rc strip". But it works to some basic level at least.
	* Tagging as RootCore-00-03-33

2014-05-07 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Reduced the number of headers that rc_rootcint would select
	  for inclusion in the CINT dictionary generation command to the
	  ones that are actually declared in the current package.
	* Tagging as RootCore-00-03-21

2014-04-23 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed MakefileObjectReflex in RootCore.py to give the
	  full path name of the rootmap file to the genreflex command.
	  Without it the rootmap file ended up in the object directory,
	  and was never linked to the main library directory.
	* Had to realise as a result that ROOT 6 dies in very
	  uninformative ways when it doesn't have a dictionary available.
	  Only realised what the issue was when using ROOT 5. :-/
	* Tagging as RootCore-00-03-17
